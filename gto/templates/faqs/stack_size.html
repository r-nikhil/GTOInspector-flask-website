	<p>
		Wonâ€™t the GTO solution depend on the stack size of the hero?

{% block answer %}
	<div id="q8">
		Correct. Our program intelligently refers to different solution databases for different hero stacks. To simplify we have made the following assumptions w.r.t to hero stack.
		<ul>
			<li>
				Hero stack <40BB =  Referred with 30BB PLO ranges
			</li>
			<li>
				Hero stack <60BB = Referred with 50BB PLO ranges
			</li>
			<li>
				Hero stack <120BB = Referred with 100BB PLO ranges
			</li>
			<li>
				Hero stack >175BB and above = Referred with 200BB PLO ranges
			</li>
		</ul>
