	<p id="q7">
		Rake has a major impact on low-stakes poker profitability. It is the driving force dictating which few players are winners. But since we don't generally have the option to play rake-free, all we can do is to try to play an optimal strategy so that we donâ€™t lose the majority of our winrate to rake. 
		<br>
		Currently all our GTO ranges are adjusted for two rake structures. PLO50 and PLO500 from pokerstars.com. You can view the exact rake structure here: https://www.pokerstars.com/poker/room/rake/
		<br>
		For comparison to an Indian site like Adda52, PLO500 would be the apt choice for players analysing hands above 200/400INR. For everything below those stakes PLO50 would be suitable.
